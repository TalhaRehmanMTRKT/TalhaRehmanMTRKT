  Optimization lies at the heart of modern engineering and operations research. In this post, 
  I'll walk you through the fundamentals of setting up a linear programming (LP) problem 
  using IBM's CPLEX solver with C++. Whether you're new to optimization or looking for a
  practical reference, this guide covers the essentials.
</p>

<h2>What is Linear Programming?</h2>

<p>
  Linear programming is a mathematical method for finding the best outcome in a model
  whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. The general form of an LP is:
</p>

$$
\min_{x} \quad c^T x
$$
$$
\text{subject to:} \quad Ax \leq b, \quad x \geq 0
$$

<p>
  Where $c$ is the cost vector, $A$ is the constraint matrix, $b$ is the right-hand side vector,
  and $x$ is the vector of decision variables.
</p>

<h2>Setting Up CPLEX in C++</h2>

<p>
  Before writing the optimization model, ensure that IBM CPLEX is installed and that your 
  IDE is configured with the correct include and library paths.
</p>

<h3>A Minimal Example</h3>

<p>Let's solve a simple problem:</p>

$$
\min \quad x_1 + 2x_2
$$
$$
\text{s.t.} \quad x_1 + x_2 \geq 10, \quad x_1 \leq 8, \quad x_1, x_2 \geq 0
$$

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;ilcplex/ilocplex.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    IloEnv env;
    try {
        IloModel model(env);

        // Decision variables
        IloNumVar x1(env, 0, IloInfinity, ILOFLOAT, "x1");
        IloNumVar x2(env, 0, IloInfinity, ILOFLOAT, "x2");

        // Objective: minimize x1 + 2*x2
        model.add(IloMinimize(env, x1 + 2 * x2));

        // Constraints
        model.add(x1 + x2 >= 10);
        model.add(x1 <= 8);

        // Solve
        IloCplex cplex(model);
        cplex.solve();

        std::cout << "Optimal x1 = " << cplex.getValue(x1) << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Optimal x2 = " << cplex.getValue(x2) << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Objective   = " << cplex.getObjValue() << std::endl;

    } catch (IloException& e) {
        std::cerr << "CPLEX Error: " << e.getMessage() << std::endl;
    }
    env.end();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Understanding the Output</h2>

<p>
  Running this program yields $x_1 = 8$ and $x_2 = 2$, with an optimal objective value of 
  $8 + 2 \times 2 = 12$. The solver verified that this solution is globally optimal.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Always check the CPLEX solution status using <code>cplex.getStatus()</code>
  to confirm the solver found an optimal solution before using the results.
</blockquote>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decision Variables:</strong> The unknowns you're solving for ($x_1$, $x_2$).</li>
  <li><strong>Objective Function:</strong> What you want to minimize or maximize.</li>
  <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> The conditions the solution must satisfy.</li>
  <li><strong>Feasible Region:</strong> The set of all points satisfying all constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>
  In the next post, we'll extend this to mixed-integer programming (MIP) where some variables
  are restricted to integer values — a critical technique for real-world energy system scheduling.
